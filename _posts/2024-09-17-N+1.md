# N+1 Pains

In modern API design, N+1 is essentially a solved problem -- when loading related data for given entities, load it up front. Laravel solves this with Eloquent's eager loading, and is a breeze to use.
We rely on this functionality to avoid getting lost in N+1 and massive unnecessary amounts of back and forth between our API and our database instance.

However - we noticed a couple of things had slipped through. After beefing up our Sentry.io integration and enabling performance monitoring, we started receiving notifications of N+1 all over the shop. We had noticed that a couple of our high traffic endpoints had started suffering degraded performance, but brushed that off as legacy endpoints accessing and transforming massive amounts of data.

As it turns out, N+1 had slipped through the net in our complacency and bit us hard.

After a minor amount of digging (Sentry's performance tooling made this as easy as it could be), we identified a couple of places where these N+1 issues were slipping through.

### Eloquent Attributes
We love eloquent attributes. They provide an easy way to compute data at runtime, and add it to the serialized model to output in the API response. However, what we didn't account for was the database noise when you start accessing relationships through attributes, e.g.

```php
public function getOwningUserNameAttribute(): string
{
  return "{$this->user->first_name} {$this->user->last_name}";
}
```

All of a sudden, when we load 20 records, an extra 20 queries are run to load the user when we serialize that record.
Multiply that by relationship accessing attributes littered throughout our models, and the performance impact can really add up.

Easy fix - add `user` to the eager loaded relationships.
